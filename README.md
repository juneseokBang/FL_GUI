# FL_GUI
Implementation of Federated Learning with GUI

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning is a machine learning approach that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. This implementation offers a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the Federated Learning process.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FL_GUI.git
cd FL_GUI
```

3. Start the Flask server to send and receive parameter values:
```
python app.py
```

3. Once the server is running, you can access the GUI by opening your web browser and navigating to 'http://localhost:5000'.

4. Use the GUI to interact with the Federated Learning process, providing input parameters and monitoring the progress.
